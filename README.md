## About The Project

With this project you can see the implementation of the information 
provided by the WorldClockAPI.

Also, you can see that in real time the information is updated.

I hosted a [demo site](https://clock.sagacious.club/) using a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pk7r/nodejs-git-docker) on an infrastructure I built myself.

### Challenge

The challenge is to find a way to use the [WorldClockAPI](http://worldclockapi.com/): 
It could be a simple page (you don't need to care about design or layout), 
some curl's examples or Postman's documentation.

* You need to display the results on screen;
* You need to use JavaScript or related programing language (i.e. NodeJS, ReactJS and others);
* We must understand your code and use your API without having to ask you any questions. Our primary language is English so please use it on comments and documentation;
* We’d like to see SOLID principles in your solution;
* You don’t need to persist any data (but feel free to do it if you want);
